    on how the publishing and use of open data can be become more sustainable. This
    includes making the process of opening up data clear and simple for any organisation.</p>\n\n<p>The
    <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.theodi.org/news/new-certificates-launched-help-everyone-discover-understand-and-use-open-data\">recent
    launch</a>\x02of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://certificates.theodi.org/\">Open
    Data Certicates</a>\x02sees the ODI begin to \x02provide tools that support best
    practices in this area. The certificates provide guidance to publishers, helping
    them to identify a variety of issues to be considered when releasing data, whilst
    also giving re-users some assurance as to the quality of open datasets.</p>\n\n<p>Data
    published to the web should always be accompanied by machine-readable metadata
    describing all aspects of the dataset including is content, origin, publication
    schedule and, importantly, clear licensing. A clear statement of re-use rights
    can ensure that consumers fully understand both how a dataset can be re-used and
    any obligations that they may incur through that usage.</p>\n\n<p>Through the
    Open Data Certificates, the ODI will be encouraging data publishers to publish
    machine-readable metadata. In fact doing so is key criteria for reaching each
    level of certification.</p>\n\n<p>There are several existing efforts to help standardise
    dataset metadata, including the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/#class-dataset\">W3C
    Data Catalog Vocabulary</a>\x02(DCAT). Publishers should use these standards to
    help describe their data.</p>\n\n<p>However in a few cases there are gaps in existing
    standards that merits further work. This is particularly true in the case of publishing
    machine-readable rights information.</p>\n\n<p>At the ODI we are currently working
    on a new vocabulary to support the publication of &ldquo;Open Data Rights Statements&rdquo;.
    The vocabulary <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/theodi/open-data-licensing/wiki/Related-Work\">builds
    upon and extends</a>\x02the Dublin Core and Creative Commons vocabularies to support
    the description of Rights Statements that may include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>A reference
    to a license for the dataset</li>\n  <li>A reference to a content license that
    applies to copyrightable parts of a dataset &ndash; an important piece of metadata
    in juristications that recognise database rights</li>\n  <li>Copyright notices</li>\n
    \ <li>Attribution metadata to support re-users in acknowledging their sources</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Alongside
    the vocabulary we have drafted guides for both <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/theodi/open-data-licensing/blob/master/guides/publisher-guide.md\">publishers</a>
    and <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/theodi/open-data-licensing/blob/master/guides/reusers-guide.md\">re-users</a>\x02that
    will describe:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>How to publish machine-readable rights statements
    as RDFa, Linked Data, or as additions to existing JSON or XML formats</li>\n  <li>How
    to link to rights statements from both web pages and APIs</li>\n  <li>Guidance
    for developers on how to apply this metadata to build attribution and citation
    links</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The guides are still a work in progress but can be viewed
    in <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://github.com/theodi/open-data-licensing\">our
    github repository</a>. We would love\x02to hear your feedback on any aspect of
    the work.\x02Please <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/theodi/open-data-licensing/issues\">submit
    issues and\x02comments on github</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Once complete these guides will
    form part of a broader set of guidance from the ODI on how to publish standards-compliant
    dataset metadata.</p>\n"
