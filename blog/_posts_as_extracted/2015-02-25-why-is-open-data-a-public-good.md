  description: "We often refer to open data as a public good, but what does this mean?
    And what does it imply about how our national information infrastructure should
    be managed?\r\nWhen I say that open data is a public good, sometimes people reply,
    “but people can do bad things with open data (so it’s not really good)” or “but
    it is more easily used by people who are data literate (so it’s not really public)”.
    These statements are both true, but based on a misunderstanding of what a ‘public
    good’ is. Wikipedia says:\r\n\r\n    In economics, a public good is a good that
    is both non-excludable and non-rivalrous in that individuals cannot be effectively
    excluded from use and where use by one individual does not reduce availability
    to others.\r\n\r\nIn other words, a public good is something that you can’t stop
    anyone using, and that doesn’t get used up. The examples of public goods that
    people tend to use are “clean air”, “lighthouses” or “public parks”. Open data
    also fits this economic definition.\r\n\r\nThe objections to describing open data
    as a public good apply equally to public parks. People can do immoral or unlawful
    things in public parks: they can let their dogs make a mess, deal drugs, mug people.
    We don’t deal with this misuse by closing public parks or having identity checks
    at every entrance, but through the same laws and social norms that apply elsewhere.
    Similarly, misuse of open data such as providing out-of-date flood alerts or misrepresenting
    statistics can and should be addressed through laws and social norms, not through
    restricting access to that data.\r\n\r\nPublic parks, like other public goods,
    don’t benefit everyone equally: those that live close by and those with children
    or dogs benefit more than those who live further away or those with impaired mobility.
    Lighthouses benefit those who own and man ships, and their families, far more
    than anyone else. Similarly, open data might bring most benefits to those for
    whom the data is relevant, those who are data literate, or those who already have
    lots of data. But from an economic point of view, these public goods are non-excludable:
    once they are available, it’s impossible to prevent others from benefiting from
    them.\r\n\r\nPublic goods cost money to create and maintain, but because it’s
    not just the people who pay for it that benefit from them, it can be hard to get
    enough people to contribute to their maintenance. This is known as the free rider
    problem: it’s the feeling “why should I pay when they’re not?” If sufficient people
    feel that way, contributions to maintenance fall away, the public good falls into
    disrepair, and everyone loses.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to open data, the fear of
    the free rider problem leading to open data disappearing can become a problem
    in itself. On several occasions I’ve heard people say they would rather pay for
    data because doing so reassures them that the data will continue to be available
    long term. Who would invest in developing a product or service reliant on a resource
    that could disappear at any time?\r\n\r\nWe can learn about how open data should
    be paid for by looking at how other public goods are maintained. There are several
    methods:\r\n\r\n    Government: Funding by government is the usual solution to
    the free rider problem. It removes people’s individual choices over contributing
    to public goods: we pay our taxes; government uses the money to create public
    goods; democracy and accountability act as controls over which public goods are
    created and maintained.\r\n\r\n    Collaboratives: Groups can club together to
    create a public good that all the members benefit from. To make this sustainable,
    and avoid members reneging on their commitment to contribute (while still being
    able to benefit from the public good the other members continue to maintain),
    such groups usually need to have a contractual obligation to ongoing contributions.\r\n\r\n
    \   Cross-subsidy: When the group that is the primary beneficiary of a public
    good also has to pay for a private good (something members from outside the group
    don’t benefit from), a portion of the payment for the private good can be used
    to subsidise the public good.\r\n\r\n    Volunteering: Volunteering can be a powerful
    mechanism for maintaining public goods. It usually needs to be supplemented with
    other types of contribution (eg you can’t pay for servers with volunteer time),
    and it requires an infrastructure that actively provides volunteers with something
    useful to do.\r\n\r\n    Social norms: Public goods can be maintained simply due
    to social pressure: creating the public good becomes the Thing To Do (and not
    maintaining it disapproved of); contributing to a public good either becomes a
    normal cost of doing business or is a target for charitable donations.\r\n\r\nFor
    open data to thrive as a public good, we will need to draw on all these models.
    What you think about how much the taxpayer should fund public goods such as open
    data will depend on your political outlook. But for sure as the role of the state
    in society changes, we will see changes in the way open data is maintained: away
    from government, as public services are mutualised or privatised; towards the
    crowd, as the internet enables collaboration.\r\n\r\nWe need to learn which governance
    models work well together; what guarantees are needed for reusers to trust the
    supply of open data; and about the range of roles that government, and everyone
    else in society, can play. And this is particularly necessary for the governance
    of open national information infrastructure, something that ODI will be particularly
    focused on this year.\r\nComments\r\nThere are no comments yet.\r\nAdd comment\r\n[?]\r\n"

    <p>We often refer to open data as a public good, but what does this mean? And what does it imply about how our national information infrastructure should be managed?</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>In <a rel="external" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FEconomics&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHEap_CeJm80puEOfOZNC8wTW1btA">economics</a>, a public good is a good that is both <a rel="external" href="http://goo.gl/s6S2ro">non-excludable</a> and <a rel="external" href="http://goo.gl/T9W076">non-rivalrous</a> in that individuals cannot be effectively excluded from use and where use by one individual does not reduce availability to others.</p>
