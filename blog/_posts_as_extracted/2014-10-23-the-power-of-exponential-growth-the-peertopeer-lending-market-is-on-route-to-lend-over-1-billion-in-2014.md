    href=\"http://theodi.org/blog/peer-peer-lending-businesses-lead-way-opening-financial-data\">Last
    year</a>, in June 2013, we estimated that the peer-to-peer (P2P) market will be
    worth £1 billion at least by the year 2016.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, market data by
    the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://p2pfa.info/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Peer-to-Peer-Lending-DataSheet-Q3-v3.pdf\">Peer-to-Peer
    Finance Association</a> shows how the P2P companies have lent £900 million\tin
    the first three quarters\tof 2014. They will hit our prediction by the end of
    this year because of an exponential growth of loans to businesses and consumers.</p>\n\n<p>This
    is a great success story for one of the first industries in the financial sector
    to embrace open data. <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://directory.theodi.org/members/YZ9195NL\">RateSetter</a>,
    an ODI member, Zopa and Funding Circle are the three leading P2P platforms in
    the UK. They were part of the consortium which published all transaction, i.e.
    14 million loan parts to highlight the regional geography of lending.</p>\n\n<p>The
    uptake of crowdfunded loans continues and is encouraged by the UK government,
    for example, by planning to introduce a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3ae23438-55d6-11e4-93b3-00144feab7de.html?siteedition=uk\">new
    individual savings account designed for peer-to-peer lending</a>.</p>\n\n<p>In
    March 2014 the Financial Conduct Authority laid down the new rules for the crowdfunding
    industry, which includes P2P. The rules were set to provide greater transparency
    and clearer information about risks, a move that was anticipated with the opening
    up of data in our project. </p>\n\n<p>The P2P industry is an example of how open
    data can create trust with consumers and regulators and therefore accelerator
    the core business proposition. Other organisations in the finance world, such
    as the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/Pages/disclaimer.aspx\">Bank
    of England</a>, have adopted the UK <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/2/\">Open
    Government Licence</a>. There is still a huge opportunity for banks to become
    more open.</p>\n\n<h4>What is P2P lending?</h4>\n\n<p>Peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms
    are online sites that match lenders to recipients. At this basic level they are
    much like banks. However, unlike banks, P2P platforms usually do not invest these
    funds solely at their own discretion. Instead some enable lenders to directly
    make investment decisions by choosing the recipient they fund or allowing lenders
    to define the general social or financial features of the projects in which they
    want to invest.</p>\n\n"
