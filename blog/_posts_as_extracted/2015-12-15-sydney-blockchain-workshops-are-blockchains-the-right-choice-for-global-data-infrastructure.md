    I’m James Smith and I’m Head of Labs at the Open Data Institute in London. The
    ODI is a nonprofit that <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/about\">connects,
    equips and inspires people around the world to innovate with data</a>. We’re not
    just about open data, though that’s an important part of it; we look at the entire
    <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/data-spectrum\">Data Spectrum</a>,
    whether closed, shared or open, big or small, government, personal or commercial.
    We see <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/data-infrastructure\">data
    as infrastructure</a> for the modern digital economy, which enables new businesses
    and societies.</p>\n\n<p>We’re very interested in the infrastructure for this
    data. If the data itself is critical infrastructure, then it has to be always
    available, resilient, redundant, and accessible from anywhere at any time. Because
    of this, we’ve got a real interest in distributed data storage technologies and
    how they can enable a global data infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p>In our work with governments
    and businesses, we’ve seen a sudden spike of interest in these ideas, and in blockchain
    technology in particular. Many organisations are saying they need some sort of
    “blockchain strategy”, maybe without always knowing what they mean by those words.
    There is a another technology gold rush happening, and we’re trying to help organisations
    understand what it is they are looking at, particularly around the open public
    data that’s an essential component of our data infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p>Any technology
    has a particular set of properties that make it unique, and as any developer will
    tell you, it’s important to pick technologies based on those properties. In the
    case of blockchains, the most important properties are shared-write, so anyone
    can store data in the system, and trust-free, so no central authority is required
    to verify those writes. It’s also very well suited to widely distributed systems.
    When asking the question “Would this be better with a blockchain?” we have to
    keep these properties in mind.</p>\n\n<p><strong>When can blockchains work best?</strong></p>\n\n<p>There
    are a lot of cases out there where a shared-write trust-free database is a very
    useful thing, particularly in widely-distributed international systems without
    an existing central authority.</p>\n\n<p>Supply chains are a great example; <a
    rel=\"external\" href=\"https://theodi.org/start-ups/provenance\">Provenance</a>,
    a graduate of the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/odi-startup-programme\">ODI
    Startup programme</a>, are building a system on top of Ethereum which allows secure,
    trusted tracing of commodities across our global supply network, so that you can
    be sure that your Fairtrade organic decaf latte really is all of those things.
    Using a blockchain approach, it manages this without any central authority, and
    without exposing commercially sensitive information.</p>\n\n<p>Domain Name System
    (DNS) is another; the ability of the network to arrive at consensus over domain
    registrations in a distributed way could remove the centralised aspects of DNS,
    which can be a security risk.</p>\n\n<p>How about real-world addresses? Addresses
    are created in a widely-distributed manner, and central authorities often take
    a very long time to update the canonical lists. Here in the UK we often find people
    in newly-built areas unable to get basic services because their address doesn’t
    exist in the database yet, despite the fact they’re physically living there. Also,
    sometimes that central authority is a privatised company, as it is now in the
    UK. Addresses are critical infrastructure, created by a widely distributed group;
    it seems a good fit. Australia has recently announced it will be opening up the
    geocoded national address file as open data; perhaps there is an opportunity there.</p>\n\n<p>However,
    we also see blockchains being suggested for things that don’t really require those
    properties.</p>\n\n<p>Land registries are a commonly-proposed use, and Odessa
    is the latest authority planning something in this area, with a <a rel=\"external\"
    href=\"http://cointelegraph.com/news/first-blockchain-powered-government-to-launch-in-odessa-ukraine\">property
    auction powered by a blockchain</a>. But what does this really add? One of the
    core jobs for a country is to look after property rights; all a blockchain approach
    can do is reduce corruption by exposing that data publicly and detecting fraud
    from within the system. Perhaps, though, if that’s necessary, there are deeper
    issues to look at first before imposing a technocratic solution.</p>\n\n<p>There
    are many other ideas being thrown around in areas where an effective centralised
    authority already exists and does the job. Applying blockchains in these areas
    can seem a bit like chasing the technology purely for its own sake, not because
    it solves a fundamental problem.</p>\n\n<p><strong>When blockchain technology
    is not the answer</strong></p>\n\n<p>There are also more controversial applications,
    where blockchains paradoxically enable more centralisation, surveillance and control.
    There is a persistent idea floating around about paying state benefits in a cryptocurrency,
    which can track how they are spent, and restrict what people can buy with them.
    No matter what you think of the idea, it’s a political and social question, not
    a technological one.</p>\n\n<p>Now, don’t get me wrong. Blockchains are an incredible
    technology for shared write, trust-free data management, and have real potential
    to revolutionise our global data infrastructure. However, many of the applications
    for which they are being mooted simply don’t need that level of capability, and
    in many cases other properties of the system are undesirable. </p>\n\n<p>A really
    important one is immutability. Once data is added to a blockchain, it’s there
    forever. It can’t be changed or removed without destroying the integrity of the
    whole system. On the surface this seems great from a technical point of view.
    However, immutability can remove the human element of our social systems.</p>\n\n<p>A
    simple example might be the <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/files/factsheets/factsheet_data_protection_en.pdf\">EU
    “right to be forgotten” judgement</a>, where EU citizens can ask to have links
    removed from Google’s index. What if the thing they want to be forgotten is stored
    in an immutable blockchain?</p>\n\n<p>And some legislation can require the full
    rewriting of history. In the UK, if you change your gender, you have a right to
    have that change reflected in all official documentation back into the past, to
    rewrite history. Not just to have the change recorded, but to make it so that
    the old information never existed. What happens if your gender is stored with
    a land purchase in a blockchain land registry? Has a supposedly neutral technology
    choice become oppressive?</p>\n\n<p>And what of illegal or private information?
    Once it’s in a blockchain, it’s extremely hard to remove. Is then everyone with
    a copy of the blockchain then guilty of possessing something they shouldn’t?</p>\n\n<p>The
    way we store information using a blockchain is really important. It seems likely
    that most systems will be hybrids, using a blockchain to store audit data and
    verify integrity, but storing the data itself in a separate data store, which
    can change and be rewritten if necessary.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Asking social questions</strong></p>\n\n<p>There
    is a danger that the rush to move things onto the blockchain will encourage a
    black-and-white view of the world, in which history is immutable and we approach
    inflexible rule-by-algorithm. As with all web-scale technologies, we need to consider
    what social impacts there are, and what consequences there may be. This is especially
    relevant in a global, immutable, public record.</p>\n\n<p>At the ODI we’re interested
    in all these social questions as well as the technology itself. We are certain
    that blockchains have a big role to play, as part of a suite of new distributed
    technologies. We’re also certain that existing institutions need help to understand
    the choices that they are making, both on a technical and social level. We want
    to work with our international network of <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.org/our-network\">ODI
    Nodes, ODI Members and ODI Startups</a> to explore these questions and help work
    out how this technology can help people. </p>\n\n<p>We want you to be part of
    that conversation as well; the challenge for all of us when applying blockchains
    to our global data infrastructure is to use them where appropriate, but to always
    remember that such systems should be designed to serve people, and that our choice
    of technology may have political and social implications. Algorithms are not politically
    neutral, the human condition is rarely black and white, and we over-simplify at
    our peril.</p>\n\n<p><strong>This talk was supported by <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.db.com/company/index.htm\">Deutsche
