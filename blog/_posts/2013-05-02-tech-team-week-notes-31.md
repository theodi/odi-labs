  excerpt: When we first convened as a tech team, and worked out our principles, one
    thing we committed to was the idea of 20% time, where we would commit one day
    a week to working on pet projects that while they might not be directly related
    to our work at the ODI, they help us stretch our skills and develop fun projects
    that may grow into something more useful.

    one thing we committed to was the idea of 20% time, where we would commit one
    day a week to working on pet projects that while they might not be directly related
    to our work at the ODI, they help us stretch our skills and develop fun projects
    that may grow into something more useful.</p>\n\n<p>As the weeks rolled on, we
    found that we weren&rsquo;t getting much 20% time done, because more important
    day to day work got in the way, so we decided to do a 5 day &ldquo;20%&rdquo;
    sprint one week in five. This was the first of such sprints, and we were quite
    busy bees:</p>\n\n<p>Tom hosted the first <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://www.meetup.com/storm-london/events/115541332/\">Storm
    London Meetup</a> on Monday night and reacquainted himself\x02with <a rel=\"external\"
    href=\"http://www.mongodb.org/\">MongoDB</a>\x02and got to know the Ruby driver,
    he finally made sense of <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/resque/resque\">Resque</a>
    and built a small app to harvest our pinboard bookmarks. He also hacked <a rel=\"external\"
    href=\"http://www.raspberrypi.org/\">Raspberry Pi</a>s with Andrea, our Training
    and Events Coordinator,\x02and tested to see if they had enough grunt to drive
    the screens (they don&rsquo;t, unless we can offload more of the work to the GPU),
    helped Ulrich get setup on Rackspace collecting data about Boris Bikes, and enabled
    one of our pods for videoconferencing using the Samsung SmartTV.</p>\n\n<p>James
    went to UCL to <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://blogs.ucl.ac.uk/research-software-development/seminar-smith-odi/\">deliver
    a presenation on our open development practices</a>, (<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://theodi.github.io/open-development/talk/#/titlepage\">you
    can see the slides here</a>), and worked on a <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://git-viewer.labs.theodi.org/\">Rails
    app that displays open data stored in Git repositories</a>\x02in\x02a nice way
    for non-developers.</p>\n\n<p>I worked on <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/theodi/odibot\">various
    different scripts</a> for our IRC bot, <a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://hubot.github.com/\">Hubot</a>
    to do various life-embettering things like add bookmarks to Pinboard, alert us
    to when the 10am standup is happening (and give a link to the Google Hangout -
    handy for\x02remote workers!), link automatically to issues in Github\x02and also
    silly things like\x02generate random words on the fly (this has already saved
    us several man hours in naming new projects - because naming things is hard).</p>\n\n<p>Sam
    worked on (in his words) <a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://github.com/theodi/vagrant-provide-o-matic\">a
    horrorshow of a Vagrantfile</a> which will allow us to spin up nodes on the fly
    for either VirtualBox (when we&rsquo;re developing on our local machines) or Rackspace
    (when we want to put stuff into production). Once the rough edges are smoothed
    out, this will prove to be really useful.</p>\n\n<p>Ulrich worked on collecting
    data about Boris Bike cycle hire data using R, with a view to collecting a decent
    amount of statistical data so we can find out interesting patterns of usage. He
    also worked on a benefit case for opening up the DVLA&rsquo;s bulk data set as
    open data, and organised a meeting with various privacy experts\x02to discuss
    the privacy section of the Open Data Certificate.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, it was a
    great week, and I think all of us packed a lot into five days. While we may not
    have got many demonstratable projects out of the sprint (it was only a week after
    all), it&rsquo;s helped lay some groundwork for some useful future projects, and
    we&rsquo;ve all leant at least one useful thing that we can carry forward into
    future work.</p>\n"
