        <p>The Open Data Institute aims to unlock the supply and demand for open data, to communicate its value, and to share tools and guidance that help others to adopt open data.</p>

<h2>Our Principles</h2>

<h3>Be Open By Default</h3>

<p>We will conduct our work in public by default. Anyone can join our IRC channel. Anyone can view our plans, which we will manage as issues and pull requests on our github projects. We encourage comments on, forking of and contributions to our work. We do this because there are more good ideas in the world than there are in ODI.</p>

<h3>Borrow Mercilessly</h3>

<p>We will build on others' work. We will avoid reinvention. We do this because it helps us focus our efforts into new areas. We will aim to contribute back to open source products we use. We do this to show our appreciation for what other people have done.</p>

<h3>Experiment and Learn</h3>

<p>We will try out new tools and new ways of working. We will reflect on whether they do what we need them to. We will adapt them to suit us, or try something else. We do this so that we continuously improve.</p>

<h3>Share Everything</h3>

<p>We will document and discuss our experiences, so others can learn from them. We will aim for the things we create to be reusable by others because we will reuse them ourselves. We will help others over the hurdles we have overcome. We do this to make the most out of everything we do.</p>

<h3>Be Ourselves</h3>

<p>We are all individuals (except for <a href="https://github.com/pikesley" class="user-mention">@pikesley</a>). We work as a team and in a community because we have a common purpose and because we can achieve more that way. We have our own interests and opinions, and will express them considerately.</p>
