Whether you want to publish your data, find open data or discover opportunities for collaboration.

We have published two guides to open data licensing to help you guide you through the process of opening up and reusing data.

They are:   

* [Publisher’s Guide to Open Data Licensing](https://theodi.org/guides/publishers-guide-open-data-licensing)  
* [Reuser’s Guide to Open Data Licensing](https://theodi.org/guides/reusers-guide-open-data-licensing)
