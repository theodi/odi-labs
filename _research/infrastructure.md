This is a critical time in the development of the distributed technology landscape; there is a danger that immature solutions will dominate, harm the potential of these technologies and potentially damage the open web, so our input will be critical.

Blockchains and similar distributed technologies are rapidly gaining traction, and are being applied in all sorts of potentially revolutionary ways. We have been asked to, and need to look at the implications of these around building standard registers, immutability, revocation of data, privacy, licensing, ownership and collaboration.

We have already started work on this through our blockchain work in early 2016, and our mid-2016 technical report.
